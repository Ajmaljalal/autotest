    // Extract relevant attributes
    return {
      tag: element.tagName.toLowerCase(),
      id: element.id || null,
      class: element.className || null,
      name: element.getAttribute('name') || null,
      placeholder: element.getAttribute('placeholder') || null,
      // Add more attributes as needed
    };
  });
  return JSON.stringify(elements);
});
```

**Benefits:**
- **Comprehensiveness**: Captures a wider range of attributes, making tests more robust.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to various webpage structures and element attributes.

- **Integration with Tools**: Use tools like Jira, TestRail, or others to manage and monitor test cases.

```typescript:src/test-generator.ts
const testMetadata = {
  url,
  testScenario,
  generatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};
fs.writeFileSync('src/test-metadata.json', JSON.stringify(testMetadata, null, 2), 'utf8');
```

**Benefits:**
- **Traceability**: Easily track which tests correspond to which scenarios and URLs.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates teamwork by integrating with existing project management tools.

### **6. Continuous Learning and Feedback Loop**

Implement a feedback mechanism to continually improve the quality of generated tests based on execution results.

- **API Interactions**: Integrate API testing alongside UI tests.

**Implementation Example:**

```typescript:src/test-generator.ts
const testScenarios = [
  'search for "AI in healthcare"',
  'submit the contact form with valid data',
  'navigate through the user registration process',
  // Add more scenarios as needed
];
```

**Benefits:**
- **Versatility**: Supports a wider range of testing needs.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Ensures thorough testing across different application functionalities.

## Additional Considerations

### **1. Rate Limiting and API Usage**

# Handling Complex Test Scenarios with Dynamic Interactions in Automated Playwright Testing

Addressing dynamic interactions, such as clicking a button to open a modal and then testing elements within that modal, introduces additional complexity to your automated Playwright testing workflow. To ensure your system can handle such scenarios effectively, you need to enhance both your prompting strategy for the LLM and your Playwright automation script. Below are comprehensive strategies and implementations to tackle these challenges.

## 1. Enhancing Prompt Engineering for Dynamic Interactions

To guide the LLM in handling multi-step interactions and extracting elements from dynamically loaded content (like modals), you should structure your prompts to include detailed instructions about the expected interactions and the order in which they should occur. Here's how you can achieve this:

### **a. Define Interaction Steps Explicitly**

Break down the test scenario into a series of explicit interaction steps. This helps the LLM understand the sequence of actions required to reach and test elements within modals or other dynamic components.

### **b. Update Prompt Structure**

Modify your prompt to include not just the static HTML but also the sequence of interactions needed to reveal additional elements. Here's an example of how to structure such a prompt:

```typescript
const prompt = `
Generate a Playwright test script based on the following test scenario and testing data. Adhere strictly to the rules provided.

**Testing Scenario**: ${testScenario}

**Testing Steps**:
1. Navigate to the URL: ${url}
2. Perform the following actions:
   ${interactionSteps} // e.g., "Click the 'Open Modal' button."
3. Test the elements within the opened modal:
   - ${modalTestSteps} // e.g., "Verify that the modal contains a 'Submit' button."

**Testing Data**: ${JSON.stringify(parsedData)}

**Rules**:
1. Return only valid Playwright JavaScript code without any additional text.
2. Ensure the code is free of syntax errors and can run successfully.
3. The code must be encapsulated within an async function named 'test'.
4. Include all necessary imports.
5. Use the 'export' keyword for the test function.
6. Follow best practices for Playwright scripting.
7. Handle asynchronous actions appropriately (e.g., waiting for modals to appear).
8. Include error handling for each interaction step.

**Example Output**:
\`\`\`javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';
export const test = async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  await page.click('#open-modal-button');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');

  await page.fill('#modal-input', 'Test Input');
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');

  await browser.close();
};
\`\`\`
`;
```

### **c. Incorporate Interaction Script Extraction**

Ensure that your Playwright script can perform the necessary interactions to reveal dynamic content before extracting the relevant HTML. This involves:

- **Executing Interactions**: Simulate user actions such as clicks, form submissions, or navigation.
- **Waiting for Elements**: Use appropriate waiting strategies (e.g., `waitForSelector`) to ensure that dynamic elements are loaded before attempting to interact with them.
- **Extracting Updated HTML**: After performing interactions, extract the updated HTML to feed into the LLM for further processing.

## 2. Modifying Your Playwright Automation Script

To support multi-step interactions and handle dynamic content, you need to enhance your existing Playwright automation script. Below is an enhanced version of your script with added functionalities to manage interactions and extract updated HTML.

### **a. Updated `runTest` Function**

```typescript
import { chromium, Browser, Page } from 'playwright';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
import fs from 'fs';

dotenv.config();

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.CLAUDAI_API_KEY
});

async function runTest(url: string, testName: string, interactionSteps: string[], modalTestSteps: string[]) {
  let browser: Browser | null = null;
  let page: Page | null = null;

  try {
    browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
    page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto(url);

    // Perform interaction steps to reveal dynamic content (e.g., open modal)
    for (const step of interactionSteps) {
      // Example step: "Click the 'Open Modal' button."
      const [action, selector] = parseStep(step);
      if (action === 'click') {
        await page.click(selector);
      }
      // Add more actions as needed (e.g., fill, navigate)
    }

    // Wait for dynamic elements to load (e.g., modal)
    await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // Adjust timeout as needed

    // Capture the updated body HTML after interactions
    const bodyHtml = await page.evaluate(() => {
      // Remove all inline styles
      const elements = document.querySelectorAll('*');
      elements.forEach(element => {
        element.removeAttribute('style');
      });

      // Remove specific head elements
      const headElements = document.body.querySelectorAll('link, script, style, svg, meta');
      headElements.forEach(el => el.remove());
      return document.body.innerHTML;
    });
    console.log('bodyHtml', bodyHtml);

    // Send the HTML and interaction steps to Claude AI for processing
    const msg: any = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
      max_tokens: 1500,
      temperature: 0.5,
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `
Extract the HTML tags and their identifiers needed for Playwright automation testing based on the following test scenario. The test scenario involves multiple interaction steps that reveal dynamic content. Ensure that elements within dynamically loaded sections (like modals) are included.

**HTML**:
${bodyHtml.trim()}

**Test Scenario**:
${testName}

**Interaction Steps**:
${interactionSteps.join('\n')}

**Modal Test Steps**:
${modalTestSteps.join('\n')}

**Rules**:
1. Only return the HTML tags and their identifiers needed for the Playwright test.
2. Include elements from both the initial page load and any dynamically loaded content after interactions.
3. Return the tags in the order they appear in the HTML.
4. Only return the required tags, nothing else.
5. Return in JSON format.

**Example Output**:
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "test_step": "click the 'Open Modal' button",
      "tag": "button",
      "id": "open-modal-button",
      "class": "btn btn-primary",
      "role": null,
      "value": null,
      "text": "Open Modal",
      "name": null
    },
    {
      "test_step": "fill the modal input",
      "tag": "input",
      "id": "modal-input",
      "class": "input-field",
      "role": null,
      "value": null,
      "text": null,
      "name": "modalInput"
    },
    {
      "test_step": "click the modal 'Submit' button",
      "tag": "button",
      "id": "modal-submit-button",
      "class": "btn btn-success",
      "role": null,
      "value": null,
      "text": "Submit",
      "name": null
    }
  ]
}
`
        }
      ]
    });

    // Extract the content.text
    const contentText = msg.content[0].text;

    // Call the new function after parsing the data
    await generatePlaywrightCode(contentText, testName);

  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      console.error('Test failed:', {
        name: error.name,
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack
      });
    } else {
      console.error('Test failed:', error);
    }
  } finally {
    if (page) await page.close();
    if (browser) await browser.close();
  }
}

function parseStep(step: string): [string, string] {
  // Simple parser to extract action and selector from step description
  // Example: "Click the 'Open Modal' button." => ["click", "#open-modal-button"]
  const clickRegex = /Click the ['"](.+)['"] button/i;
  const match = step.match(clickRegex);
  if (match) {
    const buttonName = match[1];
    // Convert button name to a selector (this is a simplistic approach)
    const selector = `button:has-text("${buttonName}")`;
    return ['click', selector];
  }
  // Add more parsing rules as needed
  return ['', ''];
}
```

**Key Enhancements:**

1. **Interaction Steps Handling**: The `runTest` function now accepts `interactionSteps` and `modalTestSteps` arrays to define the sequence of actions required to reveal dynamic content.

2. **Step Parsing**: The `parseStep` function provides a simplistic way to convert human-readable steps into actionable Playwright commands. You can expand this function to handle more complex interactions.

3. **HTML Extraction After Interactions**: After performing the interaction steps, the script waits briefly (using `waitForTimeout`) to allow dynamic content to load and then extracts the updated HTML.

4. **Enhanced Prompt for LLM**: The prompt sent to Claude AI now includes interaction steps and modal test steps, guiding the LLM to consider both initial and dynamically loaded elements.

### **b. Updated `generatePlaywrightCode` Function**

Ensure that the `generatePlaywrightCode` function can handle the extended scope of test steps, including interactions with dynamic content.

```typescript
async function generatePlaywrightCode(parsedData: any, testSenario: string) {
  const prompt = `
Generate Playwright test code based on the following test scenario and testing data. Adhere strictly to the rules provided.

**Test Scenario**: ${testSenario}

**Testing Data**:
${JSON.stringify(parsedData)}

**Rules**:
1. Return only valid Playwright JavaScript code without any additional text.
2. Ensure the code is free of syntax errors and can run successfully.
3. The code must be encapsulated within an async function named 'test'.
4. Include all necessary imports.
5. Use the 'export' keyword for the test function.
6. Follow best practices for Playwright scripting.
7. Handle asynchronous actions appropriately (e.g., waiting for modals to appear).
8. Include error handling for each interaction step.

**Example Output**:
\`\`\`javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';
export const test = async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  await page.click('#open-modal-button');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');

  await page.fill('#modal-input', 'Test Input');
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');

  await browser.close();
};
\`\`\`
`;

  try {
    const msg = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
      max_tokens: 1500,
      temperature: 0.5,
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: prompt
        }
      ]
    });

    const response: any = msg;
    const playwrightCode = response.content[0].text;

    // Validate the generated code
    if (!playwrightCode.includes('async function test')) {
      throw new Error('Generated code is invalid or incomplete.');
    }

    fs.writeFileSync('src/test.ts', playwrightCode, 'utf8');
    console.log('Playwright code saved to test.ts');

    // Optionally, trigger CI/CD pipeline or notify for manual review
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating Playwright code:', error);
    // Implement fallback mechanisms or alerts
  }
}
```

**Key Enhancements:**

1. **Detailed Prompt**: The prompt now emphasizes handling asynchronous actions and includes rules to ensure proper error handling within the generated code.

2. **Validation**: Added a validation step to check if the generated code contains the expected function structure, throwing an error if it doesn't.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling to log issues during code generation, which can be further extended to include retry mechanisms or notifications.

## 3. Implementing a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement

Dynamic interactions can introduce variability and potential errors in generated tests. Implementing a feedback loop allows you to iteratively improve the quality of generated tests based on real-world execution results.

### **a. Capture Execution Results**

After generating and potentially executing the Playwright tests, capture the results to understand if the tests passed or failed, and why.

```typescript
// After executing the test
const executeTest = async () => {
  try {
    // Code to execute the generated Playwright test
    // This could involve spawning a child process or integrating with a CI/CD pipeline
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec('npx playwright test src/test.ts', (error: any, stdout: string, stderr: string) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`Test execution failed: ${error.message}`);
        // Log failure details
        logTestFeedback('failed', error.message);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`Test output: ${stdout}`);
      // Log success
      logTestFeedback('passed', stdout);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing test:', error);
    logTestFeedback('failed', error);
  }
};

const logTestFeedback = (status: string, details: string) => {
  const feedback = {
    testScenario: testName,
    status,
    details,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
  fs.appendFileSync('src/test-feedback.json', JSON.stringify(feedback, null, 2) + '\n', 'utf8');
};
```

### **b. Analyze Feedback to Refine Prompts**

Use the feedback to identify common issues in generated tests and refine your prompts to address them.

- **Common Failures**: If certain test steps frequently fail, update the prompt to provide more detailed instructions for those steps.
- **Syntax Errors**: Adjust the prompt to emphasize code correctness and include examples that cover edge cases.

### **c. Automate Prompt Refinement**

Develop scripts or utilize machine learning techniques to automatically adjust prompts based on feedback trends.

## 4. Comprehensive Example Workflow

Combining the above enhancements, here's a step-by-step example of how your workflow would handle a scenario where clicking a button opens a modal and tests elements within that modal.

### **a. Define the Test Scenario and Interaction Steps**

```typescript
const url = 'https://www.example.com';
const testName = 'Test Modal Interaction';
const interactionSteps = [
  "Click the 'Open Modal' button."
];
const modalTestSteps = [
  "Verify that the modal contains a 'Submit' button.",
  "Fill in the 'Name' input field within the modal.",
  "Click the 'Submit' button to close the modal."
];
```

### **b. Run the Enhanced Test Function**

```typescript
runTest(url, testName, interactionSteps, modalTestSteps)
  .then(() => executeTest())
  .catch(error => console.error('Error in test workflow:', error));
```

### **c. Generated Playwright Test (`src/test.ts`)**

The LLM, guided by your enhanced prompts, would generate a Playwright test similar to the following:

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

export const test = async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  // Click the 'Open Modal' button
  await page.click('button:has-text("Open Modal")');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');

  // Verify that the modal contains a 'Submit' button
  const submitButton = await page.$('#modal-submit-button');
  if (!submitButton) {
    throw new Error('Submit button not found in modal.');
  }

  // Fill in the 'Name' input field within the modal
  await page.fill('#modal-name-input', 'John Doe');

  // Click the 'Submit' button to close the modal
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');

  await browser.close();
};
```

### **d. Execution and Feedback Logging**

Upon executing the test, the system logs the results:

```json
{
  "testScenario": "Test Modal Interaction",
  "status": "passed",
  "details": "Test executed successfully.",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-27T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

Or in case of failure:

```json
{
  "testScenario": "Test Modal Interaction",
  "status": "failed",
  "details": "Submit button not found in modal.",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-27T12:35:56.789Z"
}
```

## 5. Additional Recommendations

### **a. Utilize Selectors Efficiently**

Improve the selector strategies to make tests more robust against UI changes.

- **Data Attributes**: Encourage the use of custom data attributes (e.g., `data-testid`) in your application to provide stable selectors.
- **Relative Selectors**: Use relative selectors to minimize the impact of DOM structure changes.

### **b. Incorporate Wait Strategies**

Ensure that the script waits appropriately for dynamic content to load, reducing flakiness in tests.

- **Explicit Waits**: Use `await page.waitForSelector(selector)` to wait for specific elements.
- **Timeouts**: Adjust timeouts based on the application's performance characteristics.

### **c. Modularize Test Steps**

Break down test steps into reusable functions or modules to enhance maintainability and readability.

```javascript
const openModal = async (page) => {
  await page.click('button:has-text("Open Modal")');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');
};

const fillModalForm = async (page, name) => {
  await page.fill('#modal-name-input', name);
};

const submitModal = async (page) => {
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');
};
```

### **d. Integrate with Continuous Integration (CI) Systems**

Automate the execution of generated tests by integrating with CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions Workflow
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Playwright Tests
        run: npx playwright test src/test.ts
```

## 6. Conclusion

Automating complex Playwright tests involving dynamic interactions is achievable with careful prompt engineering, enhanced Playwright scripting, and robust error handling. By explicitly defining interaction steps, refining prompts to guide the LLM effectively, and implementing a feedback loop, you can create a resilient system capable of handling a wide range of testing scenarios. Additionally, integrating best practices in selector usage, wait strategies, and CI/CD integration will further solidify the reliability and maintainability of your automated testing workflow.

Implementing these strategies will enable your system to generate comprehensive Playwright tests that can navigate through dynamic user interactions, ensuring thorough coverage and reducing manual testing efforts.

# Choosing the Optimal Approach for Automated Playwright Test Generation with LLMs

When automating Playwright test generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Anthropic's Claude AI, a crucial architectural decision is whether to **provide the LLM with the code files of the web pages** or to **extract and supply the rendered HTML from the URLs**. Both approaches have their merits and challenges. Below, I outline the advantages and disadvantages of each method to help you determine the most suitable strategy for your use case.

## 1. Providing the Code Files for the Pages

### **Overview**

This approach involves supplying the LLM with the actual source code files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of the web pages you intend to test. The LLM can analyze the code directly to understand the structure, functionalities, and interactions of the web application.

### **Advantages**

1. **Comprehensive Insight**:
   - **Contextual Understanding**: Access to the full codebase allows the LLM to comprehend the underlying logic, dependencies, and dynamic behaviors that may not be evident in the rendered HTML alone.
   - **Advanced Element Identification**: The LLM can identify components, state management, and event handlers, enabling more sophisticated test cases.

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Static Analysis**: Analyzing code files ensures that the tests are based on the intended structure and functionality, reducing discrepancies that might arise from dynamic content loading or user interactions.

3. **Facilitates Multi-Page and Modular Testing**:
   - **Component Reusability**: Understanding component structures aids in generating reusable test modules for shared components across different pages.

4. **Enhanced Debugging and Maintenance**:
   - **Code-Level Insights**: Easier identification of potential issues or edge cases by understanding the code’s intricacies.

### **Disadvantages**

1. **Complexity and Overhead**:
   - **Increased Data Volume**: Supplying complete codebases can be resource-intensive, leading to longer processing times and higher costs, especially with LLMs that have token limits and associated usage costs.
   - **Security Concerns**: Sharing source code, especially proprietary or sensitive components, poses security risks.

2. **Environment Dependencies**:
   - **Backend Interactions**: Source code often interacts with backend services, databases, or APIs, which might not be fully represented in the frontend code, leading to incomplete test generation.

3. **Dynamic Behaviors**:
   - **Runtime States**: Certain behaviors dependent on runtime conditions, user authentication, or external data sources may not be accurately captured through static code analysis.

4. **Maintenance Effort**:
   - **Codebase Management**: Keeping the model updated with the latest code changes adds an extra layer of maintenance, especially in rapidly evolving projects.

### **Implementation Considerations**

- **Code Parsing and Preprocessing**:
  - Ensure that the code is clean, well-documented, and possibly annotated with metadata (e.g., test IDs) to aid the LLM in understanding element purposes.
  
- **Selective Exposure**:
  - Provide only relevant parts of the codebase necessary for test generation to minimize data volume and reduce security risks.

- **Integration with Version Control**:
  - Automate the synchronization between codebase updates and the LLM input to maintain consistency.

### **Example Prompt Structure**

```typescript
const prompt = `
Generate Playwright test scripts based on the following source code files and test scenarios. Adhere strictly to the rules provided.

**Test Scenario**: ${testScenario}

**Source Code Files**:
\`\`\`html
${htmlCode}
\`\`\`
\`\`\`javascript
${javascriptCode}
\`\`\`

**Rules**:
1. Return only valid Playwright JavaScript code without any additional text.
2. Ensure the code is free of syntax errors and can run successfully.
3. The code must be encapsulated within an async function named 'test'.
4. Include all necessary imports.
5. Use the 'export' keyword for the test function.
6. Follow best practices for Playwright scripting.
7. Handle asynchronous actions appropriately.
8. Include error handling for each interaction step.

**Example Output**:
\`\`\`javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

export const test = async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  await page.click('#open-modal-button');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');

  await page.fill('#modal-input', 'Test Input');
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');

  await browser.close();
};
\`\`\`
`;
```

## 2. Extracting and Providing Rendered HTML from URLs

### **Overview**

This method involves using Playwright to navigate to the target URLs, perform necessary interactions (like clicks to open modals), and then extracting the rendered HTML to supply to the LLM. The LLM uses this HTML snapshot to generate Playwright tests.

### **Advantages**

1. **Simplicity and Focus**:
   - **Direct Representation**: The extracted HTML represents the actual state of the page as seen by the user, including all dynamic content and current interactions.
   - **Reduced Data Volume**: Providing only the rendered HTML minimizes the amount of data processed by the LLM, potentially reducing costs and improving response times.

2. **Security and Privacy**:
   - **No Source Code Exposure**: Since only the visible HTML is shared, proprietary or sensitive backend code remains secure.

3. **Dynamic Content Handling**:
   - **Real-Time State**: The HTML reflects the current state of the page, capturing dynamic elements, user interactions, and runtime conditions that might be missed in static code analysis.

4. **Environment Flexibility**:
   - **Independent of Codebase Structure**: The approach is less dependent on the underlying code structure, making it adaptable to various frameworks and technologies.

### **Disadvantages**

1. **Limited Contextual Understanding**:
   - **Lack of Internal Logic**: The LLM cannot access the application’s internal logic, state management, or business rules, which might limit the sophistication of generated tests.
   
2. **Potential Incompleteness**:
   - **Partial Rendering**: If interactions or content are not fully captured during HTML extraction, the LLM might miss critical elements necessary for comprehensive testing.

3. **Dependency on Accurate Interaction Sequences**:
   - **Interaction Complexity**: Accurately capturing multi-step interactions (e.g., opening a modal, filling forms) requires precise automation scripts to ensure the HTML reflects all necessary states.

4. **Maintenance of Interaction Scripts**:
   - **Script Updates**: As the application evolves, interaction scripts used for HTML extraction may need frequent updates to align with UI changes.

### **Implementation Considerations**

- **Robust Interaction Automation**:
  - Develop comprehensive Playwright scripts that accurately perform all necessary interactions to expose dynamic content before HTML extraction.

- **HTML Sanitization**:
  - Clean the extracted HTML by removing irrelevant elements (e.g., inline styles, unnecessary scripts) to focus the LLM on essential components.

- **Handling Asynchronous Content**:
  - Implement appropriate wait strategies to ensure all dynamic content is fully loaded before extraction.

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Navigate and Interact with the Page**:
   - Use Playwright to open the URL and perform interactions such as clicking buttons to open modals.

2. **Extract Rendered HTML**:
   - After interactions, extract the updated HTML content.

3. **Provide HTML to LLM for Test Generation**:
   - Supply the sanitized and relevant HTML snapshot to the LLM along with the test scenario.

### **Example Prompt Structure**

```typescript
const prompt = `
Generate a Playwright test script based on the following test scenario and rendered HTML. Adhere strictly to the rules provided.

**Test Scenario**: ${testScenario}

**Rendered HTML**:
\`\`\`html
${renderedHtml}
\`\`\`

**Rules**:
1. Return only valid Playwright JavaScript code without any additional text.
2. Ensure the code is free of syntax errors and can run successfully.
3. The code must be encapsulated within an async function named 'test'.
4. Include all necessary imports.
5. Use the 'export' keyword for the test function.
6. Follow best practices for Playwright scripting.
7. Handle asynchronous actions appropriately (e.g., waiting for modals to appear).
8. Include error handling for each interaction step.

**Example Output**:
\`\`\`javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

export const test = async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');

  await page.click('#open-modal-button');
  await page.waitForSelector('#modal');

  await page.fill('#modal-input', 'Test Input');
  await page.click('#modal-submit-button');

  await browser.close();
};
\`\`\`
`;
```

## 4. Recommendations

### **Hybrid Approach**

Consider leveraging a **hybrid approach** that combines the strengths of both methods:

1. **Primary Method**: Use **extracted rendered HTML** for general test generation. This ensures that tests are grounded in the actual user-facing state of the application.

2. **Supplementary Code Insights**: For complex scenarios requiring deeper understanding (e.g., intricate component interactions, conditional logic), selectively provide relevant portions of the **source code files**. This can be done on a case-by-case basis to balance depth and security.

### **Enhancing Rendered HTML Approach**

If choosing to prioritize security and focus on user-facing elements, optimize the **rendered HTML approach** as follows:

1. **Comprehensive Interaction Scripts**:
   - Develop robust Playwright scripts that meticulously perform all necessary interactions to reveal dynamic content before HTML extraction.

2. **Dynamic HTML Handling**:
   - Implement mechanisms to detect and handle multi-step interactions, ensuring the extracted HTML accurately reflects all relevant states.

3. **Metadata Integration**:
   - Embed metadata (e.g., `data-testid` attributes) into the HTML to aid the LLM in identifying and interacting with elements more reliably.

4. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Break down test generation into smaller, manageable units (e.g., per page or per component) to streamline the process and improve accuracy.

### **Security Considerations**

Regardless of the chosen approach, implement the following security best practices:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to sensitive code files and rendered HTML data. Ensure that the data provided to the LLM does not expose proprietary logic or sensitive information.

2. **Sanitization and Filtering**:
   - Sanitize the extracted HTML to remove any sensitive data or unnecessary scripts. Focus solely on elements necessary for testing.

3. **Environment Isolation**:
   - Run the test generation and execution in isolated environments to prevent potential security breaches or data leaks.

### **Performance Optimization**

To manage costs and improve performance, especially when dealing with large or multiple code files:

1. **Selective Code Provisioning**:
   - Only provide parts of the codebase that are directly relevant to the test scenario. Avoid supplying entire repositories unless necessary.

2. **Caching Mechanisms**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed pages or components to reduce redundant data processing.

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Group multiple test scenarios together when possible to maximize the efficiency of LLM interactions.

### **Future-Proofing**

Ensure that your chosen approach is adaptable to future changes in both your application and the tools you use:

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Architect your test generation system in a modular fashion, allowing for easy updates and enhancements as requirements evolve.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate test generation and execution, ensuring that tests stay up-to-date with the latest application changes.

3. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Implement feedback mechanisms to continuously assess and improve the quality of generated tests based on execution results and user inputs.

## 5. Conclusion

Both **providing code files** and **extracting rendered HTML** have distinct advantages and limitations for automating Playwright test generation with LLMs. Your decision should be guided by factors such as **security requirements**, **complexity of test scenarios**, **resource constraints**, and **desired depth of test coverage**.

- **Choose Rendered HTML Extraction** if you prioritize **security, simplicity, and focusing on user-facing elements**, especially for dynamic content that needs to reflect the real-time state of the application.

- **Opt for Providing Code Files** if you require **in-depth test scenarios** that benefit from understanding the application's internal logic and structure, and if **security measures** are in place to protect sensitive code.

- **Adopt a Hybrid Approach** to balance the need for **comprehensive test coverage** and **security**, using rendered HTML for general cases and selectively incorporating code insights for complex scenarios.

By carefully evaluating your specific requirements and constraints, you can select the most effective approach to leverage LLMs for automated Playwright test generation, ultimately enhancing your testing workflow's efficiency and reliability.
